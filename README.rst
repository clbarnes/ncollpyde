A python wrapper around a subset of the ncollide rust library


* Free software: MIT License
* Documentation: https://ncollpyde.readthedocs.io.

Install
-------

``pip install ncollpyde``

Pre-built wheels are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
If you have a stable rust compiler, you should also be able to install from source.

Features
--------

* Checking whether points are inside a volume defined by a triangular mesh
* Checking the intersection of line segments with the mesh

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    # get an array of vertices and triangles which refer to those points
    import meshio
    mesh = meshio.read("tests/teapot.stl")
    vertices = mesh.points
    triangles = mesh.cells_dict["triangle"]

    # use this library
    from ncollpyde import Volume

    volume = Volume(vertices, triangles)

Containment checks:

.. code-block:: python

    # individual points (as 3-length array-likes) can be checked with `in`
    assert [-2.3051376, -4.1556454,  1.9047838] in volume
    assert [-0.35222054, -0.513299, 7.6191354] not in volume

    # many points (as an Nx3 array-like) can be checked with the `contains` method
    bools = volume.contains(np.array([
        [-2.3051376, -4.1556454,  1.9047838],
        [-0.35222054, -0.513299, 7.6191354],
    ]))
    assert np.array_equal(bools, [True, False])

    # checks can be parallelised
    volume.contains(np.random.random((1000, 3)), threads=4)


Note that v0.11 was the last to support ``meshio < 4.0``.

Known issues
------------

* Performance gains for multi-threaded queries are underwhelming, especially for ray intersections: see `this issue <https://github.com/clbarnes/ncollpyde/issues/12>`
* Very rare false positives for containment
   * Due to a `bug in the underlying library <https://github.com/rustsim/ncollide/issues/335>`_
   * Only happens when the point is outside the mesh and fires a ray which touches a single edge or vertex of the mesh.
   * Also affects ``is_backface`` result for ray intersection checks
