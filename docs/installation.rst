Stable release
--------------

To install ncollpyde, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install ncollpyde

This is the preferred method to install ncollpyde, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

Many platforms are supported with pre-compiled wheels.
If your platform does not have a wheel available,
the package will be built from the source distribution,
for which you will need a compatible `rust toolchain <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`_.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
